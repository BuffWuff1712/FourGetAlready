## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.10+** â€“ For running the backend (check version by running `python --version`)
- **pip** â€“ Python package installer (usually bundled with Python)
- **Node.js and npm** â€“ For running the frontend (check versions by running `node --version` and `npm --version`)


### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   First, clone the project repository from GitHub.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BuffWuff1712/fourgetalready.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend folder:**

   Change to the backend source folder in the terminal.

   ```bash
   cd fourgetalready/backend/src
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   Set up a Python virtual environment for the project.

   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **Linux/Mac**:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required libraries:**

   Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the backend:**

   Now, start the backend by running `main.py`.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The backend should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**

   In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory.

   ```bash
   cd fourgetalready/frontend
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   Use npm to install the required packages for the frontend.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the frontend development server:**

   Start the frontend in development mode.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
